# Social Buzz Content Popularity Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the popularity of content categories for **Social Buzz**, a rapidly growing company. The client, Social Buzz, has reached a massive scale in recent years and is seeking insights to manage and optimize their content strategy. The primary business objective is to determine the **top 5 categories** with the largest popularity based on various metrics.

The client has requested the following tasks from the project team:

1. **Audit of Big Data Practice**
2. **Recommendations for IPO**
3. **Analysis of Popular Content Categories**

This project addresses the third task, focusing on analyzing the popularity of different content categories and identifying the top 5 categories based on data-driven insights.

## Key Business Problem

The client has experienced significant growth, but they lack the resources and data-driven tools internally to handle the vast amount of data generated by their content. The company needs help analyzing and visualizing this data to improve their content strategy, enhance engagement, and optimize their operations for future scalability.

## Tasks and Methodology

### Task 1: **Data Selection and Preparation**

Before diving into the analysis, it was essential to determine which datasets would help answer the business question: "What are the top 5 categories with the largest popularity?"

The selected datasets are:
- **Reaction Score**: A numerical value representing the popularity of content based on user engagement.
- **Content ID**: A unique identifier for each piece of content.
- **Reaction Types**: Different types of reactions (e.g., likes, comments, shares) received by content.
- **Content Type**: The format or type of content (e.g., image, video, article).
- **Category**: The content category (e.g., entertainment, news, sports).

These datasets were deemed crucial to analyze how reactions and engagement vary across content categories and to identify the most popular ones.

### Task 2: **Data Cleaning and Transformation**

Once the necessary datasets were identified, the data needed to be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure its quality and consistency. The following cleaning steps were taken:

- **Removed rows with missing values**: Any rows containing null or missing data points were removed to prevent incomplete information from affecting the analysis.
- **Changed data types**: Some columns needed to have their data types corrected to align with the analysis (e.g., ensuring numeric fields were recognized as numbers).
- **Dropped irrelevant columns**: Columns that did not directly contribute to the analysis, such as administrative details or irrelevant metrics, were removed.

The result was a clean dataset that focused solely on the variables required for analyzing content popularity.

### Task 3: **Data Modeling**

After cleaning the data, the next step was to merge relevant tables to create a comprehensive dataset. The three tables were:

1. **Content Data Table**: Containing content ID and associated category.
2. **Reactions Table**: Containing content IDs, reaction types, and reaction scores.
3. **Content Type Table**: Containing content ID and content type.

These tables were merged on the **Content ID** column, ensuring that every row in the final dataset had the relevant content information, reactions, and category. The end result was a single, clean spreadsheet that contained:

- Content ID
- Content Type
- Reaction Score
- Reaction Types
- Category

### Task 4: **Data Visualization and Analysis**

Once the data was cleaned and modeled, the analysis focused on determining the **top 5 categories with the highest popularity**. This involved aggregating the reaction scores by category and ranking them to find the most popular content categories.

#### Visualizations:

The analysis was presented using the following visualizations:

- **Pie Chart**: The pie chart illustrates the distribution of popularity among different categories. It shows the relative share of total reactions each category receives, making it easier to understand which categories dominate the platform's content.
  
- **Bar Chart**: A bar chart was created to display the top 5 categories with the highest reaction scores. This chart allows for a clear comparison of category popularity, showcasing the categories that are performing the best.

Both charts were designed to provide clear and actionable
